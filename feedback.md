## Project Workflow

**Does Not Meet Expectations**

Your readme looks good, but I would like to see the planning folder
with wireframes and a link to user stories. In your readme, please
include setup instructions for your application including `rake db:create db:migrate...`

## Technical Requirements

**Meets Expectations**

Great job implementing the many-to-many relationship with collections! I also
like the feature that creates / finds authors when a new quote is created.

## Creativity / Interface

**Meets Expectations**

I would like to see you spend more time on the CSS in the future. If you're
feeling less creative design-wise, consider using a framework like Bootstrap.

## Code Quality

## Deployment and Functionality

**Meets Expectations**

I was able to sign up, create a quote and add it to a collection without problem! I
recommend associating collections with users to prevent accidental deletions
and enable you to implement a more social aspect of this app in the future.
